This is Jaesuk's workspace, I may not be available during weekdays but will push hard during weekends.
I may not be familiar with Python but am willing to learn as followings:

1. DB connection
2. collection
3. Rest API in python (prefer Django for framework)
4. Redis
5. Simple infrastructure setup (jenkins,aws)

// note: this is mainly backend work
